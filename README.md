# Lightning Traffic
Machine learning traffic lights simulator made for nwHacks 2019.

## How to Contribute

1. Go to the [Code tab](https://github.com/JadenBalogh/TrafficLights) of this repository.
2. Click the button on the left-hand side that says "Branch: master" and type in a unique name that describes your changes (this can also just be your name) and press "Create branch: *yourname*". This creates a separate "branch" of the project on which you can add changes without fear of messing up anything in the actual project. Make sure the button now says "Branch: *yourname*" before continuing.
3. You will want to first download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
4. Go into the GitHub Desktop app, and go to File > Clone Repository. You may need to sign in to your GitHub account. Scroll down to the TrafficLights repository, and press Clone. **Make sure the "Current branch" at the top is set to the one you created earlier!** You should now have a local version of the project on your computer. 
5. To open up the project in Processing, navigate to the place where you saved the local copy on your computer and open the .pde file.
6. When you've made all your changes to the Processing project, go back to GitHub Desktop and make sure all your changes are listed on the left. If you're done, add a short summary of your changes in the bottom left and press "Commit to branch".
7. Now that you're ready to upload your changes for everyone to access, go back to the Code tab of the GitHub repository. Make sure you are on your branch, then press "New Pull Request". The only thing you have to do on this next page is add a short title and optional description for all your changes, then press "Create Pull Request". Your changes will be now available for others to see, and once they have been approved by another team member, they will be added to the project!
8. Congrats, you're all done! It may seem like a lot, but all this helps immensely with keeping the project controlled and organized!

Have fun!
