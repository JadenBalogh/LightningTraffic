## Description

The project consists of an artificial inteligence that findss an optimal schedule  
for the traffic lights of a city. Initially, the AI does not know the position of the traffic lights    
nor the schedule of the cars. With time, the AI learns from the simulations and tries to minimize  
the total time spent by the cars on traffic by assigning the times when the traffic lights  
should be on and off.

## Implementation

The project was written in Java and the GUI of the simulations is done by Processing.  
The AI learning process is based on *Genetic Algorithms*.
